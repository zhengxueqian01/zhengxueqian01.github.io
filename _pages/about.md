Welcome to my personal homepage! I am currently a master's student at Zhejiang University of Technology, specializing in data visualization and large language modals. I joined the Data Visualization Group at Zhejiang University of Technology([ZJUTVIS](https://zjutvis.org)) in 2024 and under the guidance of [Prof.Guodao](https://godoorsun.org) Sun to explore these fascinating and rapidly evolving fields.
